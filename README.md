# Pedalboard Snapshot

## Description

This is a little project I'm working on to allow a musicians who uses effect pedals to track the iterative changes they make to their pedalboard as they add and replace pedals in search of the sound in their head.

The plan is to give the user the ability to create snapshots of their pedalboard by recording each pedal currently on their board at a certain point in time and making notes about individual pedals or the grouping.
